# Coding Challenges: Real-World Applications for Better Software Engineering

Helping you become a better software engineer through coding challenges that build real applications.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to a series of coding challenges designed to improve your software development skills through hands-on application building. These challenges, inspired by John Crickett, emphasize creating real-world tools and utilities rather than focusing solely on algorithms or data structures. Each challenge is intended to be achievable in less than 8 hours and is language agnostic, meaning you can complete them in any programming language you prefer.

### Key Benefits of These Challenges

- **Easy to Get Started**: The challenges guide you through creating functional applications, breaking down tasks into manageable steps.
- **Real-World Applications**: Each challenge is focused on practical software with real-world utility, rather than abstract exercises.
- **Language Agnostic**: Complete these challenges in any programming language of your choice, including Python, C++, or even multiple languages to broaden your skills.
